DIT 100

## Prerequisites
- Basic Programming Concepts
- Introduction to Databases

## Course Description
This course introduces the fundamental concepts and practices of data management using a Fourth-Generation Language (4GL). Students will learn to interact with a Database Management System (DBMS), create and manipulate database files, and develop program systems that maintain database records. The course emphasizes practical exercises to build competence in using a specific 4GL, with applications in problem analysis, program design, testing, and implementation.

## Course Objectives
- Understand the concepts and terminology used in database management systems.
- Learn basic commands required to create and manipulate database files.
- Demonstrate competence in using a specific 4GL for database management.
- Develop, design, and implement program systems based on given specifications.
- Apply knowledge of one 4GL to easily learn and use other 4GLs.
